Well nowhere as detailed as Sevens pack. I went with a more subtle effect. In light areas - not as noticeable - in dark its VERY noticeable.
 
These are basically completely Ruohis' work. I just added the shaders and extras (normal, gloss, glow)
 
The buttons on the Healthpack do alternate and glow. However due to the resolution of the video - it isn't noticable. The same goes for the the red bar beside the buttons and below the cross on the mega health. It's also animated with a pulsing light that scrolls across.

There is only bh10 modified by ooppee used in this pk3. 
bh25 and bh100 were modified from Ruohis' textures.

Enchanced some details, made animation like on original boxes for bh25 and bh100.
